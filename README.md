# Keycloak P1 Auth Plugin
Repository for the Platform One Keycloak Plugin. This plugin has passed scans in the Party Bus IL2 MissionDevOps pipeline. The Keycloak plugin has custom themes and authentication flows. The project also contains a custom quarkus extension for routing. This code is specific to the Platform One SSO delpoyment because it has some hard-coded email and web links in the theme that point to *.dsop.mil and *.dso.mil.
